js/ obvious
static/ GAE (or Python) needs to know where the static files are for reference
templates/ this is where I put the templeted html files
	base.html / this is the base html.  The other files 'inherit' tis one.  I put
			the js (for voting) and the scripts that FB needs.
	index.html / this is the main file for the FB app.  This extends base.html 
			On this file I have the list of statues for beans.
			I think I use this for all statuses as well as a per user 
			status - I just change the package that gets sent to this file
			The package of statues is contained in 'beans' - and on this file
			I just loop through whatever gets sent in and displays.
	userStatus.html / I don't think I'm using this for display at this point - just
			for posting

app.yaml / base GAE
main.py / the guts
index.yaml / GAE DB Index file
facebook.py / the Facebook SDK
